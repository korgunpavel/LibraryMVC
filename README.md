CRUD project started with JdbcApi and PostgreSQL

Then connected the shell JdbcTemplate
Do validaton and

Then when I connected Hibernate I did:
Who has the Book
Who owns the Book
The Person page displays a list of books that he has taken
On the Books page you can see who has the book, take it away, or assign it to someone

When I connected SpringJPA I made a Book SEARCH page that indicated whether someone had the book or not
Added sorting on the main page, you can also adjust the number of books shown on the page
If you own a book for more than 10 days, the book lights up red on the owner's page
